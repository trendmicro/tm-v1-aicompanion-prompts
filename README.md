## Introduction

Trend Vision One™ – Companion, a new generative AI security assistant, draws on decades of AI and ML innovation from the global team of industry-leading experts behind the Trend Vision One™ cybersecurity platform. By enabling SOC teams to accelerate daily workflows, Companion is a catalyst for improved performance to ensure your complete digital attack surface, from email, to endpoint, network, and cloud, remains secure.

Using a plain-language interface, Companion empowers users of every skill level with generative AI’s powerful analytical capabilities to enhance their performance and productivity. Including:

* Explaining and contextualizing alerts
* Triaging and recommending actions
